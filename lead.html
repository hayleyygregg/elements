                        <h2>Lead</h2>
                    
                    <p class="lead-intro">Origin of the name: The name comes from the Anglo-Saxon word for the metal, 'lead'.</p>
                    
                    <p class="lead">Lead has been known since ancient times. It has the highest atomic number of any non-radioactive element and comes in both solid and liquid forms. It is a soft, malleable and corrosion resistant material. Solid lead has a bluish-white color that tarnishes to a dull gray color when exposed to air, in liquid form the metal has a shiny chrome-silver coating. </p>
                    
                    <p class="lead">The chemical symbol comes from the Latin word for waterworks, plumbum, meaning &#8216;liquid silver&#8217;. It is sometimes found free in nature and is not considered to be a rare element as it is easily mined and refined. Once mined and transformed into man-made products Lead and its compounds become toxic and poisonous to animals and humans.</p>

                        <h2>History</h2>
                    
                    <p class="lead-intro">The ancient Romans used lead to make water pipes, some of which are still in use today. As Lead can be poisonous, the decline of the Roman empire has been partially blamed on lead in the water supply. They used Lead on a large scale, mining in Spain and Britain. Aside from water pipes they used lead for coffins, pewter tableware, and  coins. While its mining declined in the Dark Ages it reappeared in Medieval times and found new uses, such as pottery glazes, bullets, and printing type. The term &#8216;pencil lead&#8217; came from the historic association of the Romans using a stylus made out of lead for writing, but there is actually no Lead in the pencils we use today due to it being toxic. The core of the pencil is made up of a non-toxic mineral called graphite.</p>
                    
                    <p class="lead">The Greeks mined Lead on a large scale from 650 onwards and not only knew how to obtain the metal but how to covert it to white lead. This became the basis of paints for more than 2000 years, until the middle of the last century when it became a fuel additive.</p>
                    
                                        <p class="lead">Lead is used to line tanks that store corrosive liquids, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfuric_acid" class="lead-link">sulfuric acid (H2SO4)</a> and it&#8217;s high density makes it useful as a shield against X-ray and gamma-ray radiation, used in X-ray machines and nuclear reactors. Lead is also used as a covering on some wires and cables to protect them from corrosion, as a material to absorb vibrations and sounds and in the manufacture of ammunition. Most of the lead used today is used in the production on lead-acid storage batteries, such as the batteries found in automobiles.</p>
